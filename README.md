  <h2>🌟 Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    <b>AURA AI</b> was born out of a necessity to bridge the gap in women's health education. In many cultures, women's hygiene remains a <b>taboo</b> subject, leading to misinformation or silence. Developed for <b>TechSprint LDCE</b> under the Open Innovation track, AURA AI serves as a safe, anonymous, and highly intelligent space for women to seek advice without judgment.
  </p>

  <h3>🚀 Key Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Linguistic Fluidity:</b> While the UI/UX is localized in <b>Hindi and English</b>, the chatbot is powered by advanced NLP to understand and respond in <b>any language</b> the user chooses.</li>
    <li><b>Taboo-Free Zone:</b> Expert-level advice on hygiene, menstrual health, and general wellness.</li>
    <li><b>User-Centric Design:</b> Simple, intuitive interface designed to be accessible to women from all walks of life.</li>
  </ul>
